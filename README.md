# Fintrogen
Notebook for building algo trading strategies.



There are very few javascript notebooks for creating algorithmic trading strategies.


With a simple server-side rendered app, we can run the algo code on the server-side then we send the processed data to the client for visualization and analysis.

## Installation & usage

#### Install
```bash

-> cd path/to/fintrogen

```

```


## Challenges
- [x] Plotting a lot of data on the client slows down algo execution
  ```
  --> Plot big data on server-side, save results in image then share image with client
  ```
- [ ] Cleaner charts for server-side
  ```
