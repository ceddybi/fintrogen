Notebook for building algo trading strategies.



There are very few javascript notebooks for creating algorithmic trading strategies.


With a simple server-side rendered app, we can run the algo code on the server-side then we send the processed data to the client for visualization and analysis.

### Installation 


### Brokers / Market data
- [x] Interactive brokers
- [x] Finnhub
- [x] Binance
- [ ] `insert your favourite broker` ....


#### Challenges
- [x] Plotting a lot of data on the client slows down algo execution
  ```
  --> Plot big data on server-side, save results in image then share image with client
  ```
- [ ] Cleaner charts for server-side
  ```
  -->
  ```




#### Roadmap
- Live trading setup
- Cloud editor


##### Inspiration
- [Data-forge notebook](https://www.data-forge-notebook.com/)
